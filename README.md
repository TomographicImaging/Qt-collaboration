# Qt-collaboration

Open source Qt tools for the development of GUIs. 
Collaboration between STFC Scientific Computing, STFC ISIS, STFC Central Laser Facility, Diamond.

#### Note:
Qt-collaboration uses the [`qtpy`](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy) abstraction layer for Qt bindings, meaning that it works with either PySide or PyQt bindings. Thus, the package does not depend on either. If the environment does not already have a Qt binding then the user *must* install either `pyside2` or `pyqt5` or `pyqt6`.
